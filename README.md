# Deep Learning Challenge

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to develop a tool to help Alphabet Soup select applicants for funding that have the best chance succeeding in their ventures. The notebook "first_attempt.ipynb" is an initial attempt to create a model that has a 75 per cent prediction accuracy. Firstly, some preprocessing is done on the data set (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dla-1-2/m21/lms/starter/charity_data.csv) from which a neural network model was created with the purpose of classifying whether an application would be successful or not based on the information provided for each applicant. In the file "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.ipynb" the are three attempts at creating a neural network that achieves 75 per cent accuracy, however, I was not able to achieve this. 

## Contents of Repository 

This repository contains two code files located in the folder "code" mentioned above along with a folder named models that contains the four models created saved in the h5 format. Finally, there is a report, "report.md" that gives an in depth explanation of the process of trying to optimise the model to achieve a 75 per cent predication accuracy rate and folder "images" that contains images used in the report. 

## Instructions

In order to run this code on your computer sklearn, pandas and tensorflow must be installed in the environment you want use. If you want to save the models made in the code, the package pyyaml h5py must be installed also, if not then you can delete the code cells that do so. If there are difficulties trying to install tensorflow, it is recommended that you run the code in google colab, https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index. You can simply create a new notebook on google colab and uploaded the unzipped code files in this repository. 

## Contributors 

Starter code and the data set used in this repository was provided by the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp https://bootcamps.monash.edu/data/.
